# Three.js Journey Course Progress Tracker

This repository tracks my progress through the Three.js Journey course, which covers various aspects of 3D illustration using Three.js, WebGL, and related technologies. The course is divided into multiple sections, each focusing on different topics and techniques. I will create branches for each section to keep track of my progress effectively.
